Variable Examples and explanation.

    Example one:

        Public Int myAge = 21;
            On this variable I used integer meaning I am setting it to a whole number, the name is myAge, and the number is 21, meaning that my age is 21.

    Example two:

        public float gas = 21.57
            This one is a float, meaning I can use a floating decimal, meaning it doesn't have to be a whole number.

    Example three:

        public char y = x
            This is a character, meaning that the variable you are using is a single letter.

    Example four:

        public string myName = Tyus
            This is a type where you can have a variable say a specific word. In this case, my name.

    Example five: 

        public double pi = 3.14
            a double is kind of a mix between a float and a integer, you can use to be both, I think.
